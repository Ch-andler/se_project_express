# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

This Project Express is being used as a backend server for a previous project, our "What to wear?" app. The What to wear app helps users know what to wear based on the weather of their location. You can add new items, delete items, and like items. There is also a toggle for Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Technologies used in this project are:

- Postman
- MongoDB
- Routers
- Node.js
- Express
- Validator

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
